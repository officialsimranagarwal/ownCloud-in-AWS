Creating a file share &amp; sync solution using ownCloud and AWS

Scenario - Solving the Dropbox Problem ----->
According to recent research, 40-75% of employees are using Dropbox to share files
inside and outside of their businesses. Half of those Dropbox users do this even
though they know it's against the rules. More than 40% of businesses have
experienced the exposure of confidential information and the estimated average cost
of a data breach equaled $5.5 Million in 2011.
These files, containing sensitive company and customer data, are stored in a public
cloud outside of the businesses' control - possibly even outside of the country. The
potential for data leakage and security breaches is enormous and companies need to
stay compliant with their own policies and procedures for security and governance

The Solution ------->
ownCloud is an open source secure file sync and share solution which can help you
gain control of this situation and enable you to create and deploy an enterprise scale
file solution. ownCloud can run in your data center or on a public cloud, with its
servers, storage etc completely managed and controlled by your IT team and
management in accordance with your companyâ€™s governance and security
requirements.
You will implement the ownCloud solution for a small workgroup, which can cater
upto 150 users by using various AWS services. Your solution will be completely
deployed on public cloud.
